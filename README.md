# Djent
Online music/sound pattern generator

Silly idea at first, giant leap for an author.

### Info
Someone said once: "coding is just 0 and 1", and I'm saying: "music is just 0 and X".

This djent-machine uses pre-recorded sound of guitar and drums to generate infinite long random breakdown.

### Credits
Guitar sound is provided by John Lyetacker-Newman.
Drums and code is provided by me himself.
